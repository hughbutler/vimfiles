My vim configuration files
==========================

Overall, I'm shooting for minimalism and something that's pleasing to stare at
all day. I use MacVim, so some of the config is specific to it.

MacVim Replacement Icon
-----------------------

Includes a replacement .icns for MacVim's icon that's quite nice.

Inconsolata XL
--------------

Uses [Inconsolata XL](http://www.bitcetera.com/en/techblog/2009/10/09/inconsolata-xl-font/) as the font, which I really like the look of at 14pt.
